3.1.1 What Do You Think?
You’ve just been issued with a new laptop at @Apollo and are getting ready to set it up. What steps would you take to secure it before use?

3.1.2 Protecting Your Computing Devices
List of expandable sections. Select each button to expand the content.
Your computing devices are the portal to your online life, storing a lot of your personal data. Therefore, it’s important to protect the security of your devices.

Turn the firewall on
You should use at least one type of firewall (either a software firewall or a hardware firewall on a router) to protect your device from unauthorized access. The firewall should be turned on and constantly updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or organization data.

You can click here to learn how to turn on the firewall in Windows 10, or click here for Mac OS X devices.

Install antivirus and antispyware
Malicious software, such as viruses and spyware, are designed to gain unauthorized access to your computer and your data. Once installed, viruses can destroy your data and slow down your computer. They can even take over your computer and broadcast spam emails using your account. Spyware can monitor your online activities, collect your personal information or produce unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser while you are online.

To prevent this, you should only ever download software from trusted websites. However, you should always use antivirus software to provide another layer of protection. This software, which often includes antispyware, is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for viruses and delete them. Keeping your software up to date will protect your computer from any new malicious software that emerges.

Manage your operating system and browser
Hackers are always trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities that may exist in your operating system (such as Microsoft Windows or macOS) or web browser (such as Google Chrome or Apple Safari).

Therefore, to protect your computer and your data, you should set the security settings on your computer and browser to medium level or higher. You should also regularly update your computer’s operating system, including your web browser, and download and install the latest software patches and security updates from the vendors.

Set up password protection
All of your computing devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, should be password protected to prevent unauthorized access. Any stored information, especially sensitive or confidential data, should be encrypted. You should only store necessary information on your mobile device, in case it is stolen or lost.

Remember, if any one of your devices is compromised, the criminals may be able to access all of your data through your cloud storage service provider, such as iCloud or Google Drive.

IoT devices pose an even greater risk than your other computing devices. While desktop, laptop and mobile platforms receive frequent software updates, most IoT devices have their original software. If vulnerabilities are found in the software, the IoT device is likely to be vulnerable. And to make the problem worse, IoT devices require Internet access, most often relying on your local network. The result is that when IoT devices are compromised, they allow hackers access to your local network and data. The best way to protect yourself from this scenario is to set up any IoT devices on an isolated network.

Check out Shodan, a web-based IoT device scanner that helps you identify any vulnerable devices on the Internet.

3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home
Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID). Although a wireless router can be configured so that it doesn’t broadcast the SSID, this should not be considered adequate security for a wireless network.

Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password. Therefore, these details should be changed to prevent intruders from entering your home wireless network. Furthermore, you should encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption feature on your wireless router. But be aware, even with WPA2 encryption enabled, a wireless network can still be vulnerable.

Select the image to find out more about the discovery of a security flaw in the WPA2 protocol in 2017.

This vulnerability can be exploited by key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) by intruders. In simple terms, attackers break the encryption between a wireless router and a wireless device, giving them access to network data. This flaw affects all modern, protected Wi-Fi networks.

To mitigate this situation, you should:

update all wireless capable devices such as routers, laptops and mobile devices, as soon as security updates become available
use a wired connection for any devices with a wired network interface card (NIC)
use a trusted virtual private network (VPN) service when accessing a wireless network.

3.1.4 Public Wi-Fi Risks

When you are away from home, you can access your online information and surf the Internet via public wireless networks or Wi-Fi hotspots. However, there are some risks involved, which mean that it is best not to access or send any personal information when using public Wi-Fi.

You should always verify that your device isn’t configured with file and media sharing and that it requires user authentication with encryption.

You should also use an encrypted VPN service to prevent others from intercepting your information (known as ‘eavesdropping’) over a public wireless network. This service gives you secure access to the Internet, by encrypting the connection between your device and the VPN server. Even if hackers intercept a data transmission in an encrypted VPN tunnel, they will not be able to decipher it.

Don’t forget that the Bluetooth wireless protocol, found on many smartphones and tablets, can also be exploited by hackers to eavesdrop, establish remote access controls, distribute malware and drain batteries!

Therefore, my top tip is to keep Bluetooth turned off when you aren’t using it.

3.1.5 Password Security
Slider. Respond to the question by selecting a value on the scale and then submit.
You’ve logged into your new laptop and it has prompted you to change your network password. You already struggle to remember the few passwords you use for your personal accounts online.

You ask one of your colleagues for their advice. They tell you to use one of the passwords you use for your personal accounts — that’s what they do! They keep their personal passwords written down at the back of their diary, just in case they forget them.

3.1.6 A Strong Password
Here are a few simple tips to help you when choosing a strong password.

3.1.7 Using a Passphrase
In order to prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you should consider using passphrases instead of passwords. A passphrase generally takes the form of a sentence (‘Acat th@tlov3sd0gs.’), making it easier for you to remember. And because it’s longer than a typical password, it’s less vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks.

Here are a few tips for creating a good passphrase.

3.1.8 Password Guidelines
The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published improved password requirements. NIST standards are intended for government applications but can serve as a standard for other sectors as well.

Select the image for a summary of these guidelines.

These guidelines aim to place responsibility for user verification on service providers and ensure a better experience for users overall. They state:

Passwords should be at least eight characters, but no more than 64 characters.
Common, easily guessed passwords, such as ‘password’ or ‘abc123’ should not be used.
There should be no composition rules, such as having to include lower and uppercase letters and numbers.
Users should be able to see the password when typing, to help improve accuracy.
All printing characters and spaces should be allowed.
There should be no password hints.
There should be no password expiration period.
There should be no knowledge-based authentication, such as having to provide answers to secret questions or verify transaction history.

3.1.9 Password Check

3.2.1 What Is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form.

Note that the encryption itself does not prevent someone from intercepting the data. It can only prevent an unauthorized person from viewing or accessing the content. In fact, some criminals may decide to simply encrypt your data and make it unusable until you pay a ransom.

3.2.2 How Do You Encrypt Your Data?
List of expandable sections. Select each button to expand the content.
Software programs are used to encrypt files, folders and even entire drives.

Encrypting File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. It is directly linked to a specific user account and only the user that encrypts the data will be able to access it after it has been encrypted using EFS.

Select the headings to discover how to encrypt data using EFS in all Windows versions.

3.2.3 Back Up Your Data
Slide show. Select the next button to progress.
Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. To back up data properly, you will need an additional storage location for the data and you must copy the data to that location regularly.

Tap the arrows to explore some of these additional storage locations.

Home network
Storing your data locally means that you have total control of it.
Secondary location
You could copy all of your data to a network attached storage device (NAS), a simple external hard drive or maybe even back up important folders on thumb drives, CDs, DVDs or tapes. In this scenario, you are the owner of the data and you are totally responsible for the cost and maintenance of the storage device equipment.
The cloud
You could subscribe to a cloud storage service, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cost of this service will depend on the amount of storage space you need, so you may need to be more selective about what data you back up. You will have access to your backup data as long as you have access to your account.

One of the benefits of using a cloud storage service is that your data is safe in the event of a storage device failure or if you experience an extreme situation such as a fire or theft.

3.2.4 Are They Really Gone?
This is a multiple choice question. Once you have selected an option, select the submit button below
You’ve logged into your laptop but it contains some photos belonging to the previous user, who no longer works at @Apollo. Your line manager asks you to delete them. You drag the photos into the recycle bin, open the recycle bin, select them and click ‘Delete’ once again. That should do it!

Do you think the photos are really gone from the laptop?

Select the correct answer, then Submit.

3.2.5 How Do You Delete Your Data Permanently?
This component is a flipcard comprised of flippable cards containing display image. Select the front face image to flip to the back face of these card to display associated text.
Have you ever had to delete data or get rid of a hard drive? If so, did you take any precautions to safeguard the data to keep it from falling into the wrong hands?

Select the images to find out what you should do to ensure you delete your files securely and permanently.

To erase data so that it is no longer recoverable, it must be overwritten with ones and zeroes multiple times, using tools specifically designed to do just that. SDelete from Microsoft claims to have the ability to remove sensitive files completely. Shred for Linux and Secure Empty Trash for Mac OS X claim to provide a similar service.

The only way to be certain that data or files are not recoverable is to physically destroy the hard drive or storage device. Many criminals have taken advantage of files thought to be impenetrable or irrecoverable!
